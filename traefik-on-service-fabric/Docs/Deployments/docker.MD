# Deployment to Service Fabric (Windows, Linux and MacOs) using Docker
First things first, make sure you have a Service Fabric cluster up and running, either remotely or using the local development environment. Instructions on doing this can be found on the [Service Fabric documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/service-fabric/).

## Containerizing Træfik on Service Fabric
As Service Fabric rolls out more container related features, you may wish to default on containers as your packaging format. However, be aware that containerizing Træfik on Service Fabric does introduce some added complexities. Træfik needs to be able to speak to the Service Fabric API. It typically does this over http[s]://localhost:19080, depending on your container network setup, Træfik running inside a container won't be able to reach this endpoint. You can potentially inject the host IP into the `.toml` at runtime but this can get messy quite quickly. The easiest method is to simply point Træfik at the public IP address of the load balancer handling calls through to the Træfik nodes. If you do go down this route, please ensure you encrypt your data by using TLS.

## Træfik container images
There are 2 Dockerfiles provided in the [Containers](../../Containers) directory:
* Linux - `Dockerfile`
* Windows - `Dockerfile.win`

### Building the Dockerfile
Both Dockerfiles are meant as a reference for a simple container deployment, please modify appropriately for production workloads. The Dockerfiles expect to be built in a directory with the following structure:
* Dockerfile
* servicefabric.crt
* servicefabric.key
* traefik.toml

Before you build the image, update your `traefik.toml`, making sure the `clustermanagementurl` will be accessible from inside the container i.e. your Public IP or DNS.

Service Fabric can only reference containers stored on remote container registries. Once you've built this container image locally, tag it appropriately and push it up to a repository on your container registry.

**Warning**: This container image will contain your key and certificate files, please only push this image to a private container registry.

### Public container images
Containous currently ONLY host Træfik for Linux container images on their [Dockerhub repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/). These images provide a minimum distribution of Træfik and in our case need to be extended. For simple demonstrations on non-secure clusters, you can use these images directly.

## Service Fabric Container Application
Once you've got your container image stored on your remote registry, you need to create a Service Fabric Container Application of the form:
* ApplicationManifest.xml
* TraefikPkg/
    * Code/
    * ServiceManifest.xml

A sample Service Fabric Container Application has been provided [here](../../Containers/TraefikApplicationPkg).
You'll need to update the sample's configuration. Please refer to the official Service Fabric Documentation for [Windows containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers) and [Linux containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-containers-linux) to learn how.

The essential bits as far as Træfik is concerned are:
* Defining your Docker image in the `ServiceManifest.xml`
```
<EntryPoint>
      <ContainerHost>
        <ImageName><!-- ENTER YOUR IMAGE NAME AND TAG HERE --></ImageName>
      </ContainerHost>
</EntryPoint>
```
* Adding a communication endpoint for Træfik and the dashboard (optional) in the `ServiceManifest.xml`
```
<Endpoints>
      <Endpoint Name="TraefikContainerTypeEndpoint" UriScheme="http" Port="80" Protocol="http" />
      <Endpoint Name="TraefikContainerTypeDashboardEndpoint" UriScheme="http" Port="8080" Protocol="http" />
</Endpoints>
```
* Adding a Port-to-Host port mapping for each defined Træfik endpoint in the `ApplicationManifest.xml`
```
<Policies>
    <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
        <!-- ... -->
        <PortBinding ContainerPort="8080" EndpointRef="TraefikContainerTypeDashboardEndpoint"/>
        <PortBinding ContainerPort="80" EndpointRef="TraefikContainerTypeEndpoint"/>
    </ContainerHostPolicies>
</Policies>
```
* Configuring authentication to your container registry in the `ApplicationManifest.xml`
```
<Policies>
      <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
        <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="ENTER YOUR ACCOUNT NAME HERE" Password="ENTER YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD HERE" PasswordEncrypted="false"/>
        <!-- ... -->
      </ContainerHostPolicies>
</Policies>
```

Once you've configured your Service Fabric Container Application, you can simply deploy it to your Service Fabric cluster using `sfctl`.

## Gotchas

* If you are running in Azure and want to be able to ingress requests to Træfik's dashboard, you'll need to create a new Health Probe and Load Balancing Rule to map an external port to 8080.

* At this present time, Linux container images are only supported on a Linux Service Fabric cluster and Windows Server container images are only supported on a Windows Service Fabric cluster. For Windows clusters, please use the image `WindowsServer2016WithContainers` or later.
