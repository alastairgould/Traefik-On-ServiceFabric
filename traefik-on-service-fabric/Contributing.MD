# Contributing to Traefik on Service Fabric

> **Warning:**
Developing this solution is a non-trivial task especially if you are unfamiliar with the `golang`, [`dep`](https://github.com/golang/dep) and its tooling. We highly recommend taking the time to understand both `dep` and `golang` on a simpler project before starting.  

## Requirements

- Golang Environment: [Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) **NOTE**: Ensure you have your [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) and other required environment variables configured.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) Installed
- Dep Installed: [Install Guide](https://github.com/golang/dep) and [How-to](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html)
- Local Service Fabric cluster: [Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started-mac) or [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started)
- [Sample Application](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/service-fabric-dotnet-getting-started/) deployed into Service Fabric cluster
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Optional but recommended

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) with [Go Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go)
- [Delve](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Debugging-Go-code-using-VS-Code) debugger installed and configured 

## Introduction

In this doc we will focus on setting up your dev environment and assume a working knowledge of the SF provider and Traefik. 

[This blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/2018/04/05/intelligent-routing-on-service-fabric-with-traefik/) provides a good understanding of how the integration works and why it was written. It is highly recommended that you read the blog and [Traefik docs](https://docs.traefik.io/) before proceeding. 

The solution consists of several different github projects:

- [Traefik Extra Service Fabric](https://github.com/containous/traefik-extra-service-fabric): SF provider for Traefik
- [Service Fabric Go SDK](https://github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric): SF Management SDK for Go
- [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik): Builds the proxy  

The `Traefik` project imports `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` which in turn import the `Service Fabric Golang SDK` all using `dep` and versioned by CommitID pinning.

`Traefik (03ce6a) => Traefik Extra Service Fabric (29a6d7) => Service Fabric Golang SDK (8eebe1)`

To release an update of the `Service Fabric Golang SDK` a pull-request (PR) should be made to it's repository and once accepted `Traefik Extra Service Fabric`'s `gopkg.toml` can be update to reference this new CommitID and this change is PR'd. Then finally `Traefik` can be updated to reference this new version of `Traefik Extra Service Fabric`. While this provides the necessary control to version releases of `Traefik` this isn't a workable flow when developing.  

## Recommended Dev Setup

For local development you can simplify the flow by cloning both `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` and `Service Fabric Go SDK` into the `/vendor` folder of `Traefik`.

> **NOTE:** `master` of `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` is compatible with the latest `Traefik` release so checkout the right `Traefik` branch, eg. `v1.6` not `master`. 

This provides a quick and easy way to build/debug `Traefik` by making changes to `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` in the `/vendor` folder. These changes can then be checked in an pushed from each projects folder `/vendor/github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric` for example. **Note** This is only a local solution to speed things up, the full flow is required for releases. 

> **NOTE:** Be aware that `golang` is sensitive to file paths so, even if you are working on a fork, you must ensure your `Traefik` instance is located at `$gopath/src/github.com/containous/traefik`

> **NOTE:** If you do work inside `Traefik`'s `/vendor` directory, it may be helpful to delete the `.git` folder inside `Traefik` to avoid confusion between the nested git repositories.


Assuming `~/scratch` is your `gopath` then this will look roughly like this: 

```
 
~/scratch >> mkdir -p src/github.com/containous/traefik
~/scratch >> cd src/github.com/containous/traefik
~/scratch/src/github.com/containous>> git clone https://github.com/containous/traefik/

## Building & Testing

### Traefik

1. Follow [Traefik WebUI Build](https://github.com/containous/traefik/tree/master/webui#how-to-build-for-backends-developer): How to build for backend devs 

    **NOTE**: If you have an empty `/static` folder already delete it before running `make generate-ui`. This may fail on Windows, if so, please use a `bash` environment such as [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

2. Follow the [Traefik Guide](https://github.com/containous/traefik/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#method-2-using-go): Method #2 

### Testing `Traefik Extra Service Fabric` and the SDK

In the `traefik` directory run:
``` 
    go test -v ./vendor/github.com/containous/traefik-extra-service-fabric/...
    go test -v ./vendor/github.com/jjcollinge/servicefabric/...
```

## Debugging using VSCode

In your `Traefik` directory create the following files then hit `F5`. You can step and set breakpoints in both `Traefik` and the other packages in the `vendor` file.

`.vscode/launch.json`
``` json

    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [

            ],
            "showLog": true
        }
